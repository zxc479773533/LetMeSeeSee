## About

**LetMeSeeSee** is an efficient and easy-to-use remote file storage tool designed for developers and maintainers. It includes a server-side remote data storage library developed by `C++` and a client supporting `Windows/Linux/MacOS` developed by `Java`.

**LetMeSeeSee** is dedicated to solving the problem of server development and maintenance personnel running from the remote monitoring program. Every time data storage and error checking is performed, there is no need to recompile the program, modify the configuration, restart the software, and only need to configure all at the beginning, and the client sends a storage request to the corresponding storage node to obtain remote data.

You can use our library in your server code to launch a remote service with just three lines of code. The data storage function is automatically generated by the macro we provide. See the Usage section for specific instructions. In addition, we also provide a `example`, a remote system monitor developed using the `LetMeSeeSee` library for your reference.
